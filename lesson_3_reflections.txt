When would you want to use a remote repository
rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating on a file with a team, having a 
remote repository makes it
possible for all to work independently, and
simultaneously able to synchronize
their changes as soon as they are made.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository.
To have better control over the status of your
files.

Describe the differences between forks, clones
and branches. When would you use one instead of
another?
Clones are identical repositoties that you
create from a remote or local repository.
Forks are clones that you create from a
public repository on Github to another Github
account.
Branches are versions of your program that
veer off from the master branch, when you
explore or want to try out a new idea without
changing the master branch of the program.
