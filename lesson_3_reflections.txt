When would you want to use a remote repository
rather than keeping all your work local?
When collaborating on a file with a team, having a 
remote repository makes it
possible for all to work independently, and
simultaneously able to synchronize
their changes as soon as they are made.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository.
To have better control over the status of your
files.
