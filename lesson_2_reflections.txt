What happens when you initialize a repository?
Why do you need to do it?
You create a repository to create a log on all
the commits you will be making on the files.
Initializing a repository creates a .git file
in the folder that holds all the files.

How is the staging area different from the
working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is where commits are stored
once you have made some changes on a file. The
working directory just holds all the files
of a certain project, and the repository saves
all commits and previous versions. You can still
think of the changes you made on a commit
before pushing them into the repository.
